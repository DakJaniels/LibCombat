[*] Reworked event registration functions (e.g. lib:RegisterForCombatEvent). The behaviour and syntax now matches event registration of the ESO API (EVENT_MANAGER:RegisterForEvent). The old functions are still supported but may be removed in the future.
[*] LibCombat:RegisterCallbackType(callbacktype, callback, name) --> LibCombat:RegisterForCombatEvent(name, callbacktype, callback), returns: isRegistered
[*] LibCombat:UnregisterCallbackType(callbacktype, callback, name) --> LibCombat:UnregisterForCombatEvent(name, callbacktype), returns: isUnregistered
[*] LibCombat:RegisterAllLogCallbacks(callback, name) --> LibCombat:RegisterForLogableCombatEvents(name, callback)
[*] Added damage and heal events to group members (LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_GROUP_DAMAGE_IN and LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_GROUP_HEAL_IN)
[*] Small fixes
